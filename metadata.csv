The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Real Estate Owned (REO) properties are the result of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) paying a claim to a lending institution on a foreclosed property which was financed with an FHA Insured Mortgage, and the lender has transferred ownership of the property of to HUD. Typically, title to the property is not transferred (or the claim paid) until the previous owner is evicted from the property. Normally, after the home is transferred to HUD, the property will go up for auction on the HUD Home store website.","2023-12-06T23:07:30.785Z","public","a54aff75cc0a42de8456cc36a7335663","dcat:Distribution","Shapefile/ZIP","ZIP","Shapefile",NA,"https://opendata.arcgis.com/api/v3/datasets/a54aff75cc0a42de8456cc36a7335663_1/downloads/data?format=shp&spatialRefId=4326&where=1%3D1",NA,NA,NA,"U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development | HUD | Federal Housing Administration | FHA | Single Family Real Estate Owned Properties for Sale | REO | Mortgage Insurance Programs | HUD.Official.Content | NGDA | Real Property","025:00","025:000","https://hud.maps.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/a54aff75cc0a42de8456cc36a7335663/info/metadata/metadata.xml?format=default&output=html","https://hudgis-hud.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a54aff75cc0a42de8456cc36a7335663/about","2023-06-02T22:07:35.000Z",NA,"United States","org:Organization","U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development","vcard:Contact","HUD eGIS Help Desk","mailto:GIShelpdesk@hud.gov",FALSE

"dcat:Dataset","Multifamily Housing Physical Inspection Scores","HUD's Real Estate Assessment Center conducts physical property inspections of properties that are owned, insured or subsidized by HUD, including public housing and multifamily assisted housing. About 20,000 such inspections are conducted each year to ensure that assisted families have housing that is decent, safe, sanitary and in good repair. This page provides a full historical view of the results of those inspections, providing point-in-time property scores. Results are available for download as a comma-delimited dataset. Separate datasets are available for public housing and for multifamily assisted properties. The results represent the inspections conducted from 2001 through January 2015. The dataset includes property identifiers and location information. 

Detailed descriptions of the inspection processes can be found in Federal Register notices 66 FR 59084 for public housing and 65 FR77230 for Office of Housing programs. 

Making these inspection details available will enable researchers, advocacy groups and the general public to 
 1) better understand the physical condition of the HUD-assisted housing stock, as well as changes in the stock over time;
 2) hold providers accountable for housing quality; and 
3) plan for future affordable housing needs.","2019-04-11","public","HUD003","dcat:Distribution","application/xlsx","xlsx","Multifamily Physical Inspection Scores",NA,"http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pis/multifamily_physical_inspection_scores.xlsx",NA,"http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pis/DataDictionary_Multifamily_Assisted_Property_Physical.doc","text/doc","HUD | housing quality | multifamily housing | pha | physical inspection | property assessment scores | public housing","025:09","025:000","http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pis/DataDictionary_Multifamily_Assisted_Property_Physical.doc","http://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/pis.html",NA,NA,"state","org:Organization","U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development","vcard:Contact","Robert Norman","mailto:Robert.L.Norman@hud.gov",TRUE
